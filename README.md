# Fluctuation analysis code

Fluctuation analysis code used in [[Coulon, Ferguson et al. 2014 eLife](https://elifesciences.org/articles/03939)] and described in more depth in [[Coulon & Larson 2016 Meth Enzymol](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0076687916001294)].

## Requirement
- Python 3
- Scipy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter (optional, i.e. to run the notebook provided as example)

## Content
The library to perform fluctuation analysis is in `fluctuationAnalysis_eLife2014.py`.

File `fluctuationAnalysis_eLife2014.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook to illstrate how to use the library. It reproduces Fig. 2B of [[Coulon, Ferguson et al. eLife 2014](https://elifesciences.org/articles/03939)], using the data in the `data` folder.
